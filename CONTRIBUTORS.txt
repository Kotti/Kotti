Kotti Contributor Agreement
===========================

The submitter agrees by adding his or her name within the section
below named "Contributors" and submitting the resulting modified
document to the canonical shared repository location for this software
project (whether directly, as a user with "direct commit access", or
via a "pull request"), he or she is signing a contract electronically.
The submitter becomes a Contributor after a) he or she signs this
document by adding their name beneath the "Contributors" section
below, and b) the resulting document is accepted into the canonical
version control repository.

Treatment of Account
--------------------

Contributor will not allow anyone other than the Contributor to use
his or her username or source repository login to submit code to a
Kotti source repository. Should Contributor become aware of any such
use, Contributor will immediately notify Daniel Nouri.  Notification
must be performed by sending an email to daniel.nouri@gmail.com.
Until such notice is received, Contributor will be presumed to have
taken all actions made through Contributor's account. If the
Contributor has direct commit access, Daniel Nouri will have complete
control and discretion over capabilities assigned to Contributor's
account, and may disable Contributor's account for any reason at any
time.

Legal Effect of Contribution
----------------------------

Upon submitting a change or new work to a Kotti source Repository (a
"Contribution"), you agree to assign, and hereby do assign, a one-half
interest of all right, title and interest in and to copyright and
other intellectual property rights with respect to your new and
original portions of the Contribution to Daniel Nouri. You and Daniel
Nouri each agree that the other shall be free to exercise any and all
exclusive rights in and to the Contribution, without accounting to one
another, including without limitation, the right to license the
Contribution to others under the Repoze Public License. This agreement

to you any right, title or interest in or to the Program or such
portions of the Contribution that were taken from the Program. Your
transmission of a submission to the Kotti source Repository and marks
of identification concerning the Contribution itself constitute your
intent to contribute and your assignment of the work in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.
