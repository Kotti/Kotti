Change History
==============

0.7 - Unreleased
----------------

- Fix #89: Validate email address for uniqueness when user changes it.

- Fix #91: Styling of search box.

- Enabled deferred loading on File.data column.

0.7a4 - 2012-06-25
------------------

- Add minified versions JS/CSS files.

- Fix #88: logging in with email.

- Update translations.

0.7a3 - 2012-06-15
------------------

- Include ``kotti.tinymce`` which adds plug-ins for image and file
  upload and content linking to the TinyMCE rich text editor.

- Slot renderers have been replaced by normal views (or viewlets).
  ``kotti.views.slots.register`` has been deprecated in favour of
  ``kotti.views.slots.assign_slot``, which works similarly, but takes
  a view name of a registered view instead of a function for
  registration.

- Switch to fanstatic for static resource management.

  Upgrade note: This requires changes to existing `*.ini` application
  configuration files.  Concretely, you'll need to add a
  ``filter:fanstatic`` section and a ``pipeline:main`` section and
  rename an existing ``app:main`` section to ``app:Kotti`` or the
  like.  Take a look at Kotti's own ``development.ini`` for an
  example.

- Retire the undocumented ``kotti.resources.Setting`` class and table.
  ``kotti.get_settings`` will now return ``registry.settings``
  straight, without looking for persistent overrides in the database.

- Drop support for Pyramid<1.3, since we use
  ``pyramid.response.FileResponse``, and kotti_tinymce uses
  ``pyramid.view.view_defaults``.

- Fix encoding error with non-ascii passwords.

0.7a2 - 2012-06-07
------------------

- Do not allow inactive users to reset their password.


0.7a1 - 2012-06-01
------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add a new 'Image' content type and image scaling, originally from
  the kotti_image_gallery add-on.  See ``kotti.image_scales.*``
  settings.

- Add search and related setting ``kotti.search_content``.

- Add subscriber to set cache headers based on caching rules.  See
  also related setting ``kotti.caching_policy_chooser``.

- Remove TinyMCE from the core.

- Move email templates into page templates in
  ``kotti:templates/email-set-password.pt`` and
  ``kotti:templates/email-reset-password.pt``.  This is to make them
  easier to translate and customize.  This deprecates
  ``kotti.message.send_set_password``.

- Add a 'edit_inhead' slot for stuff that goes into the edit
  interface's head.  'inhead' is no longer be used in
  'edit/master.pt'.

Bugs
~~~~

- Fix bug with group edit views.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/Kotti/pull/61

- Fix bug where ``user.last_login_date`` was not set during automic
  login after the set password screen.

0.6.3 - 2012-05-08
------------------

- Add tag support.  All content objects now have tags.  They can be
  added in the UI using the "jQuery UI Tag-it!" widget.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/Kotti/pull/55 .

- Fix a bug with file download performance.

0.6.2 - 2012-04-21
------------------

- Links in Navigation view lead to node view. Added edit links
  to view the node's edit form.

- Hitting 'Cancel' now returns to the context node for add/edit views

0.6.1 - 2012-03-30
------------------

- Added button to show/hide nodes from navigation in the order screen.

- The 'rename' action now strips slashes out of names.  Fixes #53.

- Add Dutch translation.

- Allow translation of TinyMCE's UI (starting with deform 0.9.5)

- Separated out testing dependencies.  Run ``bin/python setup.py dev``
  to install Kotti with extra dependencies for testing.

- Deprecate 'kotti.includes' setting.  Use the standard
  'pyramid.includes' instead.

- Setting 'Node.__acl__' to the empty list will now persist the empty
  list instead of setting 'None'.

- Let 'pyramid_deform' take care of configuring deform with
  translation dirs and search paths.

0.6.0 - 2012-03-22
------------------

- Add Japanese translation.

- Enforce lowercase user names and email with registration and login.

- Moved SQLAlchemy related stuff from kotti.util into kotti.sqla.

- You can also append to 'Node.__acl__' now in addition to setting the
  attribute.

0.6.0b3 - 2012-03-17
--------------------

- Have the automatic ``__tablename__`` and ``polymorphic_identity``
  for CamelCase class names use underscores, so a class
  'MyFancyDocument' gets a table name of 'my_fancy_documents' and a
  type of 'my_fancy_document'.

0.6.0b2 - 2012-03-16
--------------------

- Make the 'item_type' attribute of AddForm optional.  Fixes #41.

- ``kotti.util.title_to_name`` will now return a name with a maximum
  length of 40.  Fixes #31.

0.6.0b1 - 2012-03-15
--------------------

- Use declarative style instead of class mapper for SQLAlchemy resources.

  Unfortunately, this change is backwards incompatible with existing
  content types (not with existing databases however).  Updating your
  types to use Declarative is simple.  See kotti_calendar for an
  example:
  https://github.com/dnouri/kotti_calendar/commit/509d46bd596ff338e0a88f481339882de72e49e0#diff-1

0.5.2 - 2012-03-10
------------------

- A new 'Actions' menu makes copy, paste, delete and rename of items
  more accessible.

- Add German translation.

- Populators no longer need to call ``transaction.commit()``
  themselves.

0.5.1 - 2012-02-27
------------------

- Internationalize user interface.  Add Portuguese as the first
  translation.

- A new 'Add' menu in the editor toolbar allows for a more intuitive
  adding of items in the CMS.

- Refine ``Node.copy``.  No longer copy over local roles per default.

0.5.0 - 2012-02-15
------------------

- Move Kotti's default user interface to use Twitter Bootstrap 2.

- Add a new 'File' content type.

- Add CSRF protection to some forms.

- Remove Kotti's ``FormController`` in favor of using ``pyramid_deform``.

- Use plone.i18n to normalize titles to URL parts.

- Add a separate navigation screen that replaces the former
  intelligent breadcrumbs menu.

- Use ``pyramid_beaker`` as the default session factory.

- Make ``kotti.messages.send_set_password`` a bit more flexible.

0.4.5 - 2012-01-19
------------------

- Add 'kotti.security.has_permission' which may be used instead of
  'pyramid.security.has_permission'.

  The difference is that Kotti's version will set the "authorization
  context" to be the context that you pass to 'has_permission'.  The
  effect is that 'list_groups' will return a more correct list of
  local roles, i.e. the groups in the given context instead of
  'request.context'.

- Add a template ('forbidden.pt') for when user is logged in but still
  getting HTTPForbidden.

0.4.4 - 2012-01-05
------------------

- The "Forbidden View" will no longer redirect clients that don't
  accept 'text/html' to the login form.

- Fix bug with 'kotti.site_title' setting.

0.4.3 - 2011-12-22
------------------

- Add 'kotti.root_factory' setting which allows the override Kotti's
  default Pyramid *root factory*.  Also, make master templates more
  robust so that a minimal root with '__parent__' and '__name__' can
  be rendered.

- The 'kotti.tests' was factored out.  Tests should now import from
  'kotti.testing'.

0.4.2 - 2011-12-20
------------------

- More convenient overrides for add-on packages by better use of
  'config.commit()'.

0.4.1 - 2011-12-20
------------------

- Modularize Kotti's Paste App Factory 'kotti.main'.

- Allow explicit setting of tables that Kotti creates
  ('kotti.use_tables').

0.4.0 - 2011-12-14
------------------

- Remove configuration variables 'kotti.templates.*' in favour of
  'kotti.asset_overrides', which uses Pyramid asset specs and their
  overrides.

- Remove 'TemplateAPI.__getitem__' and instead add 'TemplateAPI.macro'
  which has a similar but less 'special' API.

- Factor snippets in 'kotti/templates/snippets.pt' out into their own
  templates.  Use 'api.render_template' to render them instead of
  macros.

0.3.1 - 2011-12-09
------------------

- Add 'keys' method to mutation dicts (see 0.3.0).

0.3.0 - 2011-11-30
-------------------

- Replace `Node.__annotations__` in favor of an extended `Node.annotations`.

  `Node.annotations` will attempt to not only recognize changes to
  subobjects of type dict, it will also handle list objects
  transparently.  That is, changing arbitrary JSON structures should
  just work with regard to calling `node.annotations.changed()` when
  the structure was changed.

0.2.10 - 2011-11-22
-------------------

- 'api.format_datetime' now also accepts a timestamp in addition to datetime.

0.2.9 - 2011-11-21
------------------

- Remove MANIFEST.in in favour of using 'setuptools-git'.

0.2.8 - 2011-11-21
------------------

- Remove 'PasteScript' dependency since that would result in spurious
  errors when installing Kotti. See
  http://jenkins.danielnouri.org/job/Kotti/42/TOXENV=py27/console

0.2.7 - 2011-11-20
------------------

- Add 'PasteScript' dependency.

- Fix #11 where 'python setup.py test' would look into a hard-coded
  'bin' directory.

- Structural analysis documentation. (Unfinished; in 'analysis' directory
  during development. Will be moved to main docs when finished.)

0.2.6 - 2011-11-17
------------------

- Add `Node.__annotations__` convenience attribute.

  `Node.__annotations__` will wrap the annotations dict in such a way
  that both item and attribute access are possible.  It'll also record
  changes to dicts inside dicts and mark the parent `__annotations__`
  attribute as dirty.

- Add a welcome page.
- Delete the demo added in version 0.2.4.

0.2.5 - 2011-11-14
------------------

- Add 'TemplateAPI.render_template'; allow templates to be rendered
  conveniently from templates.

0.2.4 - 2011-11-13
------------------

- Adjust for Pyramid 1.2: INI file, pyramid_tm, Wsgiref server, pcreate and
  pserve. (MO)

- Add Kotti Demo source and documentation.

0.2.3 - 2011-10-28
------------------

- ``Node.__getitem__`` will now also accept a tuple as key.

  ``folder['1', '2']`` is the same as ``folder['1']['2']``, just more
  efficient.

- Added a new cache decorator based on ``repoze.lru``.

0.2.2 - 2011-10-10
------------------

- Change the function signature of ``kotti.authn_policy_factory``,
  ``kotti.authz_policy_factory`` and ``kotti.session_factory`` to
  include all settings from the configuration file.

0.2.1 - 2011-09-29
------------------

- Minor changes to events setup code to ease usage in tests.

0.2 - 2011-09-16
----------------

- No changes.

0.2a2 - 2011-09-05
------------------

- Fix templates to be compatible with Chameleon 2.  Also, require
  Chameleon>=2.

- Require pyramid>=1.2.  Also, enable pyramid_debugtoolbar for
  ``development.ini`` profile.

0.2a1 - 2011-08-29
------------------

- Improve database schema for ``Nodes``.  Split ``Node`` class into
  ``Node`` and ``Content``.

  This change is backward incompatible in that existing content types
  in your code will need to subclass ``Content`` instead of ``Node``.
  The example in the docs has been updated.  Also, the underlying
  database schema has changed.

- Improve user database hashing and local roles storage.

- Compatibility fix for Pyramid 1.2.
