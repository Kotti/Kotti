History
=======

0.1a8
-----

- Add slots/portlets through which thirdy party packages can extend
  Kotti and put fragments of markup into the site's HTML.  Look at
  the ``kotti.views.slots`` for documentation.

- Enable AJAX forms in the Move screen and add Growl-like notification
  for messages.

- Fixed silly packaging problem with 0.1a7 release.  Install would
  fail with ``README.rst: No such file or directory`` before.

- Fix bug with TinyMCE which would trigger "Are you sure you want to
  leave this page?" all the time.

0.1a7
-----

- Add a user management screen for adding new users and assigning them
  to roles and groups globally.  Allow new users to set their own
  passwords.

- Add "forgotten password" button to login screen; sends an e-mail
  with a reset password link.

- Add a simple user preferences screen.

- Ditch 'kotti.configuration' in favour of 'pyramid.settings'.

0.1a6
-----

- Kotti now has a 100% automated test coverage, testing a total of
  some 950 lines of code.

- Add a user dropdown menu in the edit interface that display's the
  currently logged in user's name and contains links to Site Setup (in
  the works) and Logout.

- Require Chameleon < 1.2.999 since higher version cause compatibility
  issues with ``pyramid`` and ``deform``.

- Implemented a simple events system in ``kotti.events`` that's akin
  to Zope3's object events.  See the module for documentation and
  examples.

- Add a ``request_cache`` cache decorator in ``kotti.util`` for
  memoizing function results in the current request.  Cut down number
  of recursive queries run by ``kotti.security.list_groups_ext``.

0.1a5
-----

- Add sharing screen.

  This allows you to set roles for groups and users on individual
  folders.  This also considers roles that are inherited from higher
  up in the hierarchy, and those that are inherited from groups that
  the user belongs to.

- Refined available system roles in ``kotti.security.ROLES``.  We now
  have:

  - Viewer: view
  - Editor: view, add, edit
  - Owner: view, add, edit, manage
  - Admin: all permissions

0.1a4
-----

- Added login form.

  With the development profile in ``development.ini``, log in with
  user 'admin' and password 'qwerty'.  User management and sharing tab
  is a TODO.

- Add a default user database implementation in
  ``kotti.security.Principals``.
  
  Override with ``kotti.principals`` configuration setting.

- Add inheritbale, nested groups support.
  
  Groups are stored in ``Node.__groups__``.  The API is
  ``kotti.security.list_groups`` and ``kotti.security.set_groups``.
