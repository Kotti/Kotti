INI File
--------

Kotti is configured using an INI configuration file.  The
:ref:`installation` section explains how to get hold of a sample
configuration file.  The ``[app:kotti]`` section in it might look like
this:

.. code-block:: ini

  [app:kotti]
  use = egg:Kotti
  pyramid.reload_templates = true
  pyramid.debug_authorization = false
  pyramid.debug_notfound = false
  pyramid.debug_routematch = false
  pyramid.debug_templates = true
  pyramid.default_locale_name = en
  pyramid.includes = pyramid_debugtoolbar
                     pyramid_tm
  mail.default_sender = yourname@yourhost
  sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///%(here)s/Kotti.db
  kotti.site_title = Kotti
  kotti.secret = changethis1

Various aspects of your site can be changed right here.

============================  ==================================================

Only the settings in bold letters required.  The rest has defaults.

Do take a look at the required settings (in bold) and adjust them in
your site's configuration.  A few of the settings are less important,
and sometimes only used by developers, not integrators.

kotti.secret and kotti.secret2
------------------------------

The value of ``kotti.secret`` will define the initial password of the
``admin`` user.  Thus, if you define ``kotti.secret = mysecret``, the
admin password will be ``mysecret``.  Log in and change the password
at any time through the web interface.

The ``kotti.secret`` token is also used for signing browser session
cookies.  The ``kotti.secret2`` token is used for signing the password
reset token.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.secret = myadminspassword
  kotti.secret2 = $2a$12$VVpW/i1MA2wUUIUHwY6v8O

.. note:: Do not use these values in your site

.. _asset_overrides:

Override templates (``kotti.asset_overrides``)
----------------------------------------------

In your settings file, set ``kotti.asset_overrides`` to a list of
*asset specifications*.  This allows you to set up a directory in your
package that will mirror Kotti's own and that allows you to override
Kotti's templates on a case by case basis.

As an example, image that we wanted to override Kotti's master layout
template.  Inside the Kotti source, the layout template is located at
``kotti/templates/view/master.pt``.  To override this, we would add a
directory to our own package called ``kotti-overrides`` and therein
put our own version of the template so that the full path to our own
custom template is
``mypackage/kotti-overrides/templates/view/master.pt``.

We can then register our ``kotti-overrides`` directory by use of the
``kotti.asset_overrides`` setting, like so:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.asset_overrides = mypackage:kotti-overrides/

Use add-ons
-----------

Add-ons will usually include in their installation instructions which
settings one should modify to activate them.  Configuration settings
that are used to activate add-ons are:

- ``pyramid.includes``
- ``kotti.available_types``
- ``kotti.base_includes``
- ``kotti.configurators``

.. _pyramid.includes:

pyramid.includes
````````````````

``pyramid.includes`` defines a list of hooks that will be called when
your Kotti app starts up.  This gives the opportunity to third party
packages to add registrations to the *Pyramid Configurator API* in
order to configure views and more.

Here's an example.  Let's install the `kotti_twitter`_ extension and
add a Twitter profile widget to the right column of all pages.  First
we install the package from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

  bin/pip install kotti_twitter

Then we activate the add-on in our site by editing the
``pyramid.includes`` setting in the ``[app:kotti]`` section of our INI
file.  (If a line with ``pyramid.includes`` does not exist, add it.)

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.includes = kotti_twitter.include_profile_widget

kotti_twitter also asks us to configure the Twitter widget itself, so
we add some more lines right where we were:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti_twitter.profile_widget.user = dnouri
  kotti_twitter.profile_widget.loop = true

The order in which the includes are listed matters.  For example, when
you add two slots on the right hand side, the order in which you list
them in ``pyramid.includes`` will control the order in which they will
appear.  As an example, here's a configuration with which the search
widget will be displayed above the profile widget:

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.includes =
      kotti_twitter.include_search_widget
      kotti_twitter.include_profile_widget

Read more about `including packages using 'pyramid.includes'`_ in
the Pyramid documentation.

.. _including packages using 'pyramid.includes': http://readthedocs.org/docs/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/environment.html#including-packages

.. _kotti.available_types:

kotti.available_types
`````````````````````

The ``kotti.available_types`` setting defines the list of content
types available.  The default configuration here is:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.available_types = kotti.resources.Document kotti.resources.File

An example that removes ``File`` and adds two content types:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.available_types =
      kotti.resources.Document
      kotti_calendar.resources.Calendar
      kotti_calendar.resources.Event

.. _kotti.populators:

kotti.populators
````````````````

The default configuration here is:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.populators = kotti.populate.populate

Populators are functions with no arguments that get called on system
startup.  They may then make automatic changes to the database (before
calling ``transaction.commit()``).

.. _kotti.search_content:

kotti.search_content
````````````````````

Kotti provides a simple search over the content types based on
kotti.resources.Content. The default configuration here is:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.search_function = kotti.views.util.default_search_content

You can provide an own search function in an add-on and register this
in your INI file. The return value of the search function is a list of
dictionaries, each representing a search result:

.. code-block:: python

  [{'title': 'Title of search result 1',
    'description': 'Description of search result 1',
    'path': '/path/to/search-result-1'},
   {'title': 'Title of search result 2',
    'description': 'Description of search result 2',
    'path': '/path/to/search-result-2'},
   ...
   ]

An add-on that defines an alternative search function is
`kotti_solr`_, which provides an integration with the `Solr`_ search
engine.

.. _user interface language:

Configure the user interface language
-------------------------------------

By default, Kotti will display its user interface in English.  The
default configuration is:

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.default_locale_name = en

You can configure Kotti to serve a German user interface by saying:

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.default_locale_name = de_DE

The list of available languages is `here
<https://github.com/Pylons/Kotti/tree/master/kotti/locale>`_.

Configure authentication and authorization
------------------------------------------

You can override the authentication and authorization policy that
Kotti uses.  By default, Kotti uses these factories:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.authn_policy_factory = kotti.authtkt_factory
  kotti.authz_policy_factory = kotti.acl_factory

These settings correspond to
`pyramid.authentication.AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy`_ and
`pyramid.authorization.ACLAuthorizationPolicy`_ being used.

Sessions
--------

The ``kotti.session_factory`` configuration variable allows the
overriding of the default session factory.  By default, Kotti uses
``pyramid_beaker`` for sessions.

Caching
-------

You can override Kotti's default set of cache headers by changing the
``kotti.views.cache.caching_policies`` dictionary, which maps policies
to headers.  E.g. the ``Cache Resource`` entry there caches all static
resources for 32 days.  You can also choose which responses match to
which caching policy by overriding Kotti's default cache policy
chooser through the use of the ``kotti.caching_policy_chooser``
configuration variable.  The default is:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.caching_policy_chooser = kotti.views.cache.default_caching_policy_chooser

Local navigation
----------------

Kotti provides a build in navigation widget, which is disabled by default.
To enable the navigation widget add the following to the ``pyramid.includes``
setting:

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.includes = kotti.views.slots.includeme_local_navigation

The add-on `kotti_navigation`_ provides also a navigation widget with more features.
With this add-on included your configuration looks like:

.. code-block:: ini

  pyramid.includes = kotti_navigation.include_navigation_widget

Check the documentation of `kotti_navigation`_ for more options.
