Overview
========

Kotti is most useful when you are developing CMS-like applications that

- have complex security requirements,
- use workflows, and/or
- work with hierarchical data.

Built on top of a number of *best-of-breed* software components, most notably Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_, Kotti introduces only a few concepts of its own, thus hopefully keeping the learning curve flat for the developer.

.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

Features
--------

You can **try out the default installation** on `Kotti's demo page`_.

The Kotti CMS is a content management system that's heavily inspired by Plone_.
Its **main features** are:

- **User-friendliness**: editors can edit content where it appears; thus the edit interface is contextual and intuitive

- **WYSIWYG editor**: includes a rich text editor

- **Responsive design**: Kotti builds on `Twitter Bootstrap`_, which looks good both on desktop and mobile

- **Templating**: easily extend the CMS with your own look & feel with little programming required (see :ref:`static-resource-management`)

- **Add-ons**: install a variety of add-ons and customize them as well as many aspects of the built-in CMS by use of an INI configuration file (see :ref:`configuration`)

- **Security**: the advanced user and permissions management is intuitive and scales to fit the requirements of large organizations

- **Internationalized**: the user interface is fully translatable, Unicode is used everywhere to store data (see :ref:`translations`)

For developers
--------------

For developers, Kotti delivers a strong foundation for building different types of web applications that either extend or replace the built-in CMS.

Developers can add and modify through a well-defined API:

- views,
- templates and layout (both via Pyramid_),
- :ref:`content-types`,
- "portlets" (see :mod:`kotti.views.slots`),
- access control and the user database (see :ref:`develop-security`),
- workflows (via `repoze.workflow`_),
- and much more.

Kotti has a **down-to-earth** API.
Developers working with Kotti will most of the time make direct use of the Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_ libraries.
Other notable components used but not enforced by Kotti are Colander_ and Deform_ for forms, and Chameleon_ for templating.

Kotti itself is `developed on Github`_.
You can check out Kotti's source code via its GitHub repository.
Use this command:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:Kotti/Kotti

`Continuous testing`_ against different versions of Python and with *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL* and *SQLite* and a complete test coverage make Kotti a **stable** platform to work with.  |build_status|_
