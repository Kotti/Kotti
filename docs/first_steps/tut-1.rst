Tutorial part 1: Customize the Look and Feel
============================================

Let's learn by example.  We'll create an add-on package that will:

- change the look and feel of Kotti by registering an additional CSS file
- add content types and forms
- add a portlet

.. note::

    If have questions going through this tutorial, please post
    a message to the `mailing list`__ or join the `#kotti channel on
    irc.freenode.net`__ to chat with other Kotti users who might be
    able to help.

In this part of the tutorial, we'll concentrate on how to create the
new add-on package, how to install and register it with our site, and how
to manage static resources in Kotti.

Kotti add-ons are proper Python packages. They include kotti_media, for
adding a set of video and audio content types to a site, kotti_gallery,
for adding a photo album content type, kotti_blog, for blog and blog entry
content types, etc.

The add-on we will make, kotti_mysite, is just like those, in that it will be
a proper Python package created with the same tools used to make kotti_media,
kotti_blog, and the others. We will install kotti_mysite into our virtualenv,
in the same way that we might wish later to install kotti_media.

So, we are working in the mysite directory, a virtualenv. We will create the
add-on as mysite/kotti_mysite. kotti_mysite will be a proper Python package,
installable to our virtualenv.

Creating the Add-On Package
---------------------------

To create our add-on, we'll use a starter template from
``kotti_paster``.  For this, we'll need to first install the
``kotti_paster`` package into our virtualenv (the one that was created
during the :ref:`installation`).

.. code-block:: bash

  bin/pip install kotti_paster

With ``kotti_paster`` installed, we can now create the skeleton for
the add-on package:

.. code-block:: bash

  bin/paster create -t kotti_addon kotti_mysite

Running this command, it will ask us a number of questions.  Hit
enter for every question to accept the defaults.  When finished,
observe that a new directory called ``kotti_mysite`` was added to the
current working directory, as mysite/kotti_mysite.

Installing our New Add-On
-------------------------

To install the add-on (or any add-on, as discussed above) into our Kotti
site, we'll need to do two things:

- install the package into our virtualenv
- include the package inside our site's ``app.ini``

.. note::

  Why two steps?  Installation of our add-on as a Python package is
  different from activating the add-on in our site. Consider that you
  might have multiple add-ons installed in a virtualenv, but you might
  elect to activate a subset, as you experiment or develop add-ons.

To install the package into the virtualenv, we'll change into the new
``kotti_mysite`` directory, and issue a ``python setup.py develop``.
This will install the package in *development mode*:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd kotti_mysite
  ../bin/python setup.py develop

.. note::

  python setup.py install is for normal installation of a finished package,
  but here, for kotti_mysite, we will be developing it for some time, so we
  use python setup.py develop. Using this mode, a special link file is created
  in the site-packages directory of your virtualenv. This link points to the
  package directory, so that any changes you make to the software will be
  reflected immediately without having to do an install again.

Step two is configuring our Kotti site to include our new
``kotti_mysite`` package.  To do this, open the ``app.ini`` file, which
you downloaded during :ref:`installation`.  Find the line that says:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.configurators = kotti_tinymce.kotti_configure

And add ``kotti_mysite.kotti_configure`` to it:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.configurators =
      kotti_tinymce.kotti_configure
      kotti_mysite.kotti_configure

Now you're ready to fire up the Kotti site again:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ..
  bin/pserve app.ini

Visit the site in your browser and notice how the the title now has a
shadow.

Adding CSS Files
----------------

How was the color for the shadow changed?  Take a look into the directory
``kotti_mysite/kotti_mysite/static/`` -- this is where the CSS file
lives.

How is it hooked up with Kotti?  Kotti uses fanstatic_ for managing
its static resources.  fanstatic has a number of cool features -- you
may want to check out their homepage to find out more.

Take a look at ``kotti_mysite/kotti_mysite/static.py`` to see how the
creation of the necessary fanstatic components is done:

.. code-block:: python

  from fanstatic import Group
  from fanstatic import Library
  from fanstatic import Resource
  from kotti.fanstatic import base_css

  library = Library("kotti_mysite", "static")
  kotti_mysite_css = Resource(library, "style.css", depends=[base_css])
  kotti_mysite_group = Group([kotti_mysite_css])

The ``depends=[base_css]`` argument to ``Resource`` is required so
that your CSS is included after Kotti's own, so that Kotti's styles are
overridden as needed.

If you wanted to add a JavaScript file, you would do this very
similarly.  Maybe like this, in ``kotti_mysite/kotti_mysite/static.py``:

.. code-block:: python

  kotti_mysite_js = Resource(library, "script.js")

And change the last line to:

.. code-block:: python

  kotti_mysite_group = Group([kotti_mysite_css, kotti_mysite_js])

.. _fanstatic: http://www.fanstatic.org/

Configuring the Package with ``kotti.configurators``
----------------------------------------------------

Remember when we added ``kotti_mysite.kotti_configure`` to the
``kotti.configurators`` setting in the ``app.ini`` configuration file?
This is how we told Kotti to call additional code on start-up, so that
add-ons have a chance to configure themselves.  The function in
``kotti_mysite`` that's called on application start-up lives in
``kotti_mysite/kotti_mysite/__init__.py``.  Let's take a look:

.. code-block:: python

  def kotti_configure(settings):
      settings['kotti.fanstatic.view_needed'] += ' kotti_mysite.static.kotti_mysite_group'

Here, ``settings`` is a Python dictionary with all configuration variables in
the ``[app:kotti]`` section of our ``app.ini``, plus the defaults.  The values
of this dictionary are merely strings.  Notice how we add to the string
``kotti.fanstatic.view_needed``.

..note:

   Note the initial space in ' kotti_mysite.static.kotti_mysite_group', which
   allows a handy use of += on different lines -- after concatenation of the
   string parts, blanks will delimit them.

This ``kotti.fanstatic.view_needed`` setting, in turn, controls which
resources are loaded in the public interface (as compared to the edit
interface).

As you might have guessed, we could have also completely replaced all
of Kotti's resources for the public interface by overriding the
``kotti.fanstatic.view_needed`` setting instead of adding to it, like
so:

.. code-block:: python

  def kotti_configure(settings):
      settings['kotti.fanstatic.view_needed'] = ' kotti_mysite.static.kotti_mysite_group'

This is useful if you've built your own custom bootstrap theme.
Alternatively, you can completely :ref:`override the master template
<asset_overrides>` for even more control (e.g. if you don't want to
use Bootstrap).

See also :ref:`configuration` for a full list of Kotti's configuration
variables, and :ref:`static resources` for a more complete discussion
of how Kotti handles static resources through fanstatic.

In the :ref:`next part <tut-2>` of the tutorial, we'll add our first
content types, and add forms for them.
