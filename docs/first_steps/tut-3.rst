Tutorial Part 3: User interaction
=================================

In this part of the tutorial, we will change the site we made in the previous
one so our users can actually vote on our polls.

Enabling voting on Poll Choices
-------------------------------

We will enable users to vote using a new view. When the user goes to that link,
his or her vote will be saved and they will be redirected back to the Poll.

First, let's construct a new view inside ``views.py``.

.. code-block:: python

  from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPFound


  def vote_view(context, request):
      context.votes += 1
      return HTTPFound(location=request.resource_url(context.parent))

The view will be called on the Choice content type, so the context is the
Choice itself. We add 1 to the current votes of the Choice, then we do a
redirect using *HTTPFound*. The location is the parent of our context - the
Poll in which our Choice resides.

The view needs to be wired to our site. Add this to the ``__init__.py`` file,
inside the existing ``inlcudeme`` function.

.. code-block:: python


  def includeme(config):
      from kotti_mysite.views import vote_view

      config.add_view(
          vote_view,
          context=Choice,
          name="vote",
          permission="edit",
          )

With this, we can now vote on a Choice by appending /vote at the end of the
Choice URL.

Changing the Poll view so we see the votes
------------------------------------------

First, we will add some extra content into our poll_view so we are able to show
current votes of a Choice.

.. code-block:: python

  def poll_view(context, request):
      kotti_mysite_group.need()
      choices = context.values()
      all_votes = sum(choice.votes for choice in choices)
      return {
          'choices': choices,
          'all_votes': all_votes,
          }

Our view will now be able to get the sum of all votes in the poll via the
*all_votes* variable. We will also want to change the link to go to our new
vote view.
Open ``poll.pt`` and change the link into

.. code-block:: html

  <a href="${request.resource_url(choice)}/vote">
    ${choice.title}
  </a> (${choice.votes}/${all_votes})

This will add the number of votes/all_votes after each choice and enable us to
vote by clicking on the Choice. Fire up the server and go test it now.

Adding an info block about voting on the view
---------------------------------------------

As you can see, the voting now works, but it doesn't look particulary good.
Let us at least add a nice information bubble when we vote alright? The easiest
way to go about that is to use ``request.session.flash``, which allows us to
flash different messages (success, error, info etc.). Change the ``vote_view``
to include the the flash message before redirecting.

.. code-block:: python

  def vote_view(context, request):
    context.votes += 1
    request.session.flash(u'You have just voted for the choice "{0}"'.format(
        context.title), 'info')
    return HTTPFound(location=request.resource_url(context.parent))

As before, I encourage you to play around a bit more, as you learn much by
trying our new things. A few ideas on what you could work on are:

- Change the Choice content type so it has an extra description field that is
  not required (if you change database content, you will need to delete the
  database or do a migration). Then make a new Choice view that will list the
  extra information.
- Make sure only authenticated users can vote, anonymous users should see the
  results but when trying to vote, it should move them to the login page. Also
  make sure that each user can vote only once, and list all users who voted
  for the Choice on the Choice's view.
