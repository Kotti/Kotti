Bigger tasks
============

- Image and file uploads through TinyMCE, and a browsable folder for
  media (ideas?).  (iElectric)

- A pluggable settings screen for content items for things like 'allow
  discussion', 'default page'.

- Create add-ons kotti_disqus, kotti_feed (RSS), kotti_blog that make
  use of some of the features above.

- Allow in-page macros for things like 'table of contents' (for
  listing all contained pages in a TOC style).  See
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kotti/Kck0kYK3EkQ/YCu45JsJbI8J

- Add an item to the control panel that lists a list of logged
  application exceptions.  Possibly other introspectable features,
  like version numbers etc.

Have an idea for this list?  Discuss at
http://groups.google.com/group/kotti or #kotti on IRC.

Smaller tasks
=============

- To allow for easier integration with 'repoze.workflow', add a
  'state' attribute to the Content class.  Write a cookbook entry for
  using 'repoze.workflow'.

- Move more navigation related functionality out of TemplateAPI and
  into snippets.

- Many of the templates used in 'kotti/views/edit.py' have some legacy
  cruft in them.  Clean up.

- Clean up tests to consistently use 'assert' instead of
  'self.assertEquals'.  Create unit tests for some of the edit views;
  some of these are currently only tested in browser.txt.

- Clean up code to use 'DBSession' directly instead of instantiating
  a 'session = DBSession()' before use.

- Make a proper LICENSE.txt file, listing all licenses of components we use.
